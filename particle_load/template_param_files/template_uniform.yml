# See template.yml for all available options.

# MAIN PARTICLE LOAD PARAMETERS #
sim_name:            my_ics            # [REQUIRED] A label for the ICs, used amongst others as the base name for ICs files.
cosmology:           Planck2018        # [REQUIRED] The cosmology to be used by IC_Gen and (if enabled) written to the simulation parameter file. Must be one of 'Planck2013' or 'Planck2018'.
box_size:            100.0             # [REQUIRED] The full simulation box size [Mpc]. Only needed for uniform volume ICs, for zooms this is read from the mask file.
target_mass:         1e10              # [Semi-optional] Desired mass of target-resolution particles [M_Sun]; the actually used mass is generally slightly different to accommodate an integer cube number of glass files. If it is not specified, uniform_particle_number must be.
target_mass_type:    gas               # Specifies whether `target_mass` refers to the mass of gas, dm, their mean (only if gas is identified) or dmo (only if gas is not identified). Default: gas

# BARYON GENERATION #
identify_gas:            False         # Should gas particles directly be identified in the particle load?
generate_extra_dm_particles:  False     # Should extra DM particles be generated instead of assigning subsets of grid/glass particles as DM and gas (default: False)? Only relevant if `identify_gas` is True.
extra_dm_particle_scheme:     None      # Scheme to place extra DM particles relative to their "parent" gas particles in case of ambiguity (default: None, use defaults based on `dm_to_gas_number_ratio`). Options are 'face' (default) or 'edge' [N = 3, 4]; 'square' [N = 4]; 'subcube' (default) or 'diamond' [N = 7].  
dm_to_gas_number_ratio:       None      # [Semi-optional] If gas is to be identified in the particle load, what would be the ideal ratio of DM to gas particle numbers? REQUIRED if `generate_extra_dm_particles` is True. Otherwise, if not specified (or None), dm_to_gas_mass_ratio must be.
dm_to_gas_mass_ratio:         1.0       # [Semi-optional] If gas is to be identified in the particle load, what would be the ideal ratio of DM to gas particle masses? If not spefified (or None), dm_to_gas_number_ratio must be.    

# I/O SETTINGS #
icgen_object_dir:      ./suite/ICs/object   # [Semi-optional] IC_Gen base directory for all ICs of this object. If it is not specified, icgen_work_dir must be.

# PARTICLE LOAD DETAILS #
zone1_type:                 glass      # Pattern type to use for highest-resolution gcells: `glass' (default) or `grid'.

# ZOOM-SPECIFIC OPTIONS #
is_zoom:                False          # [REQUIRED] Is this a zoom simulation?

# HIGH-LEVEL OPTIONS FOR SETTING UP SUBSEQUENT CODES #
generate_param_files:   True           # Auto-generate parameter files (default: True)?
generate_submit_files:  True           # Auto-generate submit files (default: True)?
code_types:             IC_Gen         # Codes to generate files for (Default and only option: IC_Gen)
z_initial:              127.0          # [REQUIRED] Redshift to generate ICs at (only needed if param or submit files are to be generated).

# OPTIONS FOR SETTING UP IC_GEN #
panphasian_descriptor:   "[Panph1,L16,(31250,23438,39063),S12,CH1050187043,EAGLE_L0100_VOL1]"      # [REQUIRED] String encoding the phases to use for the ICs from the Panphasia field.
icgen_exec:               ../../IC_Gen.x    # [REQUIRED] Location of IC_Gen executable (absolute or relative to icgen_work_dir).
icgen_powerspec_dir:      ../..      # [REQUIRED] Directory containing the power spectrum file (absolute or relative to icgen_work_dir).
icgen_module_setup:       ~/.module_load_icgen   # [REQUIRED] File to source in order to set up the correct environment for IC_Gen (None to not source anything). 
icgen_use_PH_IDs:         True        # Assign Particle IDs based on Peano-Hilbert index (default: True)?
icgen_PH_nbit:            21          # Depth of Peano-Hilbert grid for assigning particle IDs (default: 21).
fft_n_base:               3           # Base factor for FFT grid size; FFT grid is a power of two times this number. Must be consistent with what was used to calculate Panphasian descriptor (default: 3).
